    Given the existing data in managed table "TTAB_TWO" :
      | key | value | other  |

    And the commit "source init" has been saved with all the identified initial diff content
    And the user has requested an export starting by the commit with name "source init"
    And these changes are applied to table "TTAB_TWO" :
      | change | key | value | other       |
      | update | A   | 1     | Same a upd2 |
      | add    | C   | 3     | Same c add  |
      | add    | D   | 4     | Same d add  |
    And a new commit "source update 1" has been saved with all the new identified diff content
    And these changes are applied to table "TTAB_TWO" :

    And the user has requested an export of the commit with name "source update 2"
    And the user accesses to the destination environment with the same dictionary
    And the feature "RECORD_IMPORT_WARNINGS" is enabled
    And the exported package for commit "source init" has been merged in destination environment

      | update | A   | 1     | Different a upd |
      | add    | B   | 2     | Different b add |
    And a commit "destination update 1" has been saved with all the new identified diff content in destination environment

    And the user has selected all content for merge commit
    And the user has specified a commit comment ":construction: merged with warnings"
