Feature: Some transformers can be set for a project to adapt commits at import regarding various rules

  Scenario: The list of configured transformers for a project is available to all users
    Given from the home page
    When the user access to list of transformers
    Then the provided template is list of transformers

  Scenario: The existing transformers from project are listed
    Given the configured transformers for project "Default" :
      | name                  | type                  | priority | configuration                                                                                                                        |

    When the user access to list of transformers
    Then the 3 configured transformers from project "Default" are displayed

  Scenario: The available types of transformers are listed
    Given from the home page
    When the user access to list of transformers
    Then the available transformer types are :
      | name                  | type                       |
      | LOWERCASE_TRANSFORMER | LowerCaseTransformer       |
      | UPPERCASE_TRANSFORMER | UpperCaseTransformer       |
      | EFLUID_AUDIT          | EfluidAuditDataTransformer |

  Scenario: A transformer can be initialized for a specified type with a default configuration
    Given from the home page
    When the user access to list of transformers
    And the user select a transformer type "UPPERCASE_TRANSFORMER" to add
    Then the provided template is transformer definition edit
    And the transformer definition configuration is :
      """json
      {
        "tablePattern" : ".*",
        "columnNames" : [ ".*","COL_.*","COL_C" ]
      }
      """

  Scenario: The transformer configuration cannot be saved if not valid for transformer rules
    Given the user has initialized a new transformer of type "UPPERCASE_TRANSFORMER", with name "Test" and this configuration :
      """json
      {
        "tablePattern" : ".*"
      }
      """
    When the user try to save the transformer
    Then an error is provided with this message :
      """txt
      At least one column name must be specified. Use ".*" as default to match all
      """

  Scenario: The transformer configuration can be saved if valid for transformer rules
    Given the user has initialized a new transformer of type "UPPERCASE_TRANSFORMER", with name "Test" and this configuration :
      """json
      {
        "tablePattern" : ".*",
        "columnNames" : [ ".*","COL_.*","COL_C" ]
      }

    When the user try to save the transformer
    Then the transformer with name "Test" of type "UPPERCASE_TRANSFORMER" exists

  Scenario Outline: The transformer configuration validation rules depends on transformer type - UPPERCASE_TRANSFORMER
    Given the user has initialized a new transformer of type "UPPERCASE_TRANSFORMER", with name "<name>" and this configuration :
      """json
      <configuration>
      """
    When the user save the transformer
