Feature: A dictionary is associated to versions

  Scenario: The list of specified versions is available to all users
    Given from the home page
    When the user access to list of versions
    Then the provided template is list of versions

  Scenario: The existing versions are listed
    Given the existing versions "v1, v2"
    When the user access to list of versions
    Then the 2 existing versions are displayed

  Scenario: A version can be added
    Given the existing versions "v1, v2"
    When the user add new version "v3"
    Then the 3 updated versions are displayed

  Scenario: A version can be removed from the list of versions if not used in commits
    Given the existing versions "v1, v2, v3"
    And the version v1 has no lots
    When the user delete version "v1"
    Then the 2 existing versions are displayed
    And a confirmation message on delete is displayed

  Scenario: When a version is added, the content of the dictionary is available for version compare
    Given the existing versions "v1"
    And this dictionary is added to current default domain :
      | entry name | table name  | select clause            | filter clause | key name | key type  |
      | My Entry   | T_TABLE_ONE | cur."COL_A", cur."COL_B" | 1=1           | COL_KEY  | PK_STRING |
      | My Entry 2 | T_TABLE_TWO | cur."COL_A", cur."COL_B" | 1=1           | COL_KEY  | PK_STRING |
    When the user add new version "v2"
    Then the version v2 contains this dictionary content :
      | entry name | table name  | select clause            | filter clause | key name | key type  |
      | My Entry   | T_TABLE_ONE | cur."COL_A", cur."COL_B" | 1=1           | COL_KEY  | PK_STRING |
      | My Entry 2 | T_TABLE_TWO | cur."COL_A", cur."COL_B" | 1=1           | COL_KEY  | PK_STRING |

  Scenario: Each added version manages its dictionary content for version compare
    Given the existing versions "vInit"
    And this dictionary is added to current default domain :
      | entry name | table name  | select clause            | filter clause | key name | key type  |
      | My Entry   | T_TABLE_ONE | cur."COL_A", cur."COL_B" | 1=1           | COL_KEY  | PK_STRING |
      | My Entry 2 | T_TABLE_TWO | cur."COL_A", cur."COL_B" | 1=1           | COL_KEY  | PK_STRING |
    And the user add new version "v2"
    And this dictionary is modified to current default domain :
      | entry name | table name  | select clause            | filter clause | key name | key type  |
      | My Entry   | T_TABLE_ONE | cur."COL_A"              | 1=1           | COL_KEY  | PK_STRING |

      | My Entry 3 | T_TABLE_BIS | cur."COL_A", cur."COL_B" | 1=1           | COL_KEY  | PK_ATOMIC |
    And the user add new version "v3"
    Then the version v2 contains this dictionary content :
      | entry name | table name  | select clause            | filter clause | key name | key type  |
      | My Entry   | T_TABLE_ONE | cur."COL_A", cur."COL_B" | 1=1           | COL_KEY  | PK_STRING |
      | My Entry 2 | T_TABLE_TWO | cur."COL_A", cur."COL_B" | 1=1           | COL_KEY  | PK_STRING |
    Then the version v3 contains this dictionary content :
      | entry name | table name  | select clause            | filter clause | key name | key type  |
      | My Entry   | T_TABLE_ONE | cur."COL_A"              | 1=1           | COL_KEY  | PK_STRING |
      | My Entry 2 | T_TABLE_TWO | cur."COL_A", cur."COL_B" | 1=1           | COL_KEY  | PK_STRING |
      | My Entry 3 | T_TABLE_BIS | cur."COL_A", cur."COL_B" | 1=1           | COL_KEY  | PK_ATOMIC |

  Scenario: A version can be compared to another one and all the identified differences are displayed
    Given the existing versions "vInit"
    And this dictionary is added to current default domain :
      | entry name | table name  | select clause            | filter clause | key name | key type  |
      | My Entry   | T_TABLE_ONE | cur."COL_A", cur."COL_B" | 1=1           | COL_KEY  | PK_STRING |
      | My Entry 2 | T_TABLE_TWO | cur."COL_A", cur."COL_B" | 1=1           | COL_KEY  | PK_STRING |
    And the user add new version "v2"
    And this dictionary is modified to current default domain :
      | entry name | table name  | select clause            | filter clause           | key name | key type  |
      | My Entry   | T_TABLE_ONE | cur."COL_A"              | cur."COL_B" is not null | COL_KEY  | PK_STRING |

    And the user add new version "v3"
    When the user request to compare the version "v2" with last version
    Then these domain changes are identified for the dictionary content :
      | domain      | change   | unmodified table count |
      | Test domain | MODIFIED | 1                      |
