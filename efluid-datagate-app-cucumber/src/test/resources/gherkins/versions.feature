Feature: A dictionary is associated to versions

Scenario: The existing versions are listed
   Given two version
   When the user access to list of versions
   Then the 2 existing versions are ordered into their CreatedTime order

  Scenario: The list of specified versions is available to all users
    Given from the home page
    When the user access to list of versions
    Then the provided template is list of versions

  Scenario: The existing versions are listed
    Given the existing versions v1, v2
    When the user access to list of versions
    Then the 2 existing versions are displayed

  Scenario: A version can be added
    Given the existing versions v1, v2
    When the user add new version v3
    Then the 3 updated versions are displayed

  Scenario: When a version is added, the content of the dictionary is available for version compare
    Given the existing versions v1
    And this dictionary is added to current default domain :
      | entry name | table name  | select clause            | filter clause | key name | key type  |
      | My Entry   | T_TABLE_ONE | cur."COL_A", cur."COL_B" | 1=1           | COL_KEY  | PK_STRING |
      | My Entry 2 | T_TABLE_TWO | cur."COL_A", cur."COL_B" | 1=1           | COL_KEY  | PK_STRING |
    When the user add new version v2
    Then the version v2 contains this dictionary content :
      | entry name | table name  | select clause            | filter clause | key name | key type  |
      | My Entry   | T_TABLE_ONE | cur."COL_A", cur."COL_B" | 1=1           | COL_KEY  | PK_STRING |
      | My Entry 2 | T_TABLE_TWO | cur."COL_A", cur."COL_B" | 1=1           | COL_KEY  | PK_STRING |

  Scenario: Each added version manages its dictionary content for version compare
    Given the existing versions vInit
    And this dictionary is added to current default domain :
      | entry name | table name  | select clause            | filter clause | key name | key type  |
      | My Entry   | T_TABLE_ONE | cur."COL_A", cur."COL_B" | 1=1           | COL_KEY  | PK_STRING |
      | My Entry 2 | T_TABLE_TWO | cur."COL_A", cur."COL_B" | 1=1           | COL_KEY  | PK_STRING |
    And the user add new version v2
    And this dictionary is modified to current default domain :
      | entry name | table name  | select clause            | filter clause | key name | key type  |
      | My Entry   | T_TABLE_ONE | cur."COL_A"              | 1=1           | COL_KEY  | PK_STRING |
      | My Entry 2 | T_TABLE_TWO | cur."COL_A", cur."COL_B" | 1=1           | COL_KEY  | PK_STRING |
      | My Entry 3 | T_TABLE_BIS | cur."COL_A", cur."COL_B" | 1=1           | COL_KEY  | PK_ATOMIC |
    And the user add new version v3
    Then the version v2 contains this dictionary content :
      | entry name | table name  | select clause            | filter clause | key name | key type  |
      | My Entry   | T_TABLE_ONE | cur."COL_A", cur."COL_B" | 1=1           | COL_KEY  | PK_STRING |
      | My Entry 2 | T_TABLE_TWO | cur."COL_A", cur."COL_B" | 1=1           | COL_KEY  | PK_STRING |
    Then the version v3 contains this dictionary content :
      | entry name | table name  | select clause            | filter clause | key name | key type  |
      | My Entry   | T_TABLE_ONE | cur."COL_A"              | 1=1           | COL_KEY  | PK_STRING |
      | My Entry 2 | T_TABLE_TWO | cur."COL_A", cur."COL_B" | 1=1           | COL_KEY  | PK_STRING |
      | My Entry 3 | T_TABLE_BIS | cur."COL_A", cur."COL_B" | 1=1           | COL_KEY  | PK_ATOMIC |

  Scenario: A version can be updated to mark last changes in dictionary
    Given the existing versions v1, v2, v3
    When the user update version v3
    Then the 3 updated versions are displayed
    And the update date of version v3 is updated

  Scenario: The source dictionary version must be present in destination environment when processing a merge if validation feature is enabled
    Given the existing data in managed table "TTAB_TWO" :
      | key | value | other     |
      | JJJ | One   | Other JJJ |
      | KKK | Two   | Other KKK |
      | VVV | 333   | Other VVV |
      | III | 444   | Other III |
    And the commit ":tada: Test commit init source" has been saved and exported with all the identified initial diff content
    And the user accesses to the destination environment with the same dictionary
    And the existing version in destination environment is different
    And the feature "VALIDATE_VERSION_FOR_IMPORT" is enabled
    And the existing data in managed table "TTAB_TWO" in destination environment :
      | key | value | other     |
      | VVV | 333   | Other VVV |
      | III | 444   | Other III |
    And a commit ":construction: Destination commit 1" has been saved with all the new identified diff content in destination environment
    When the user import the available source package
    Then a merge diff fail with error code VERSION_NOT_IMPORTED

  Scenario: The source dictionary version may be missing in destination environment when processing a merge if validation feature is disabled
    Given the existing data in managed table "TTAB_TWO" :
      | key | value | other     |
      | JJJ | One   | Other JJJ |
      | KKK | Two   | Other KKK |
      | VVV | 333   | Other VVV |
      | III | 444   | Other III |
    And the commit ":tada: Test commit init source" has been saved and exported with all the identified initial diff content
    And the user accesses to the destination environment with the same dictionary
    And the existing version in destination environment is different
    And the feature "VALIDATE_VERSION_FOR_IMPORT" is disabled
    And the existing data in managed table "TTAB_TWO" in destination environment :
      | key | value | other     |
      | VVV | 333   | Other VVV |
      | III | 444   | Other III |
    And a commit ":construction: Destination commit 1" has been saved with all the new identified diff content in destination environment
    When the user import the available source package
    Then a merge diff is running
