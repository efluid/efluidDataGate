Feature: The backlog can be exported

  The backlog content (commit with indexes, lob content and attachments) can be exported in a standardized format, ready to be important in
  a distant managed instance

  Background:
    Given the existing data in managed table "TTAB_ONE" :
      | key | value | preset   | something |
      | 14  | AAA   | Preset 1 | AAA       |
      | 25  | BBB   | Preset 2 | BBB       |
      | 37  | CCC   | Preset 3 | CCC       |
      | 38  | DDD   | Preset 4 | DDD       |
      | 39  | EEE   | Preset 5 | EEE       |
    And the existing data in managed table "TTAB_TWO" :
      | key | value | other     |
      | JJJ | One   | Other JJJ |
      | KKK | Two   | Other KKK |
    And the existing data in managed table "TTAB_THREE" :
      | key   | value | other   |
      | 11111 | A     | Other A |
      | 22222 | B     | Other B |
      | 33333 | C     | Other C |

  Scenario: The export is prepared in 2 steps - details on export all
    Given the commit ":tada: Test commit init" has been saved with all the identified initial diff content
    And these changes are applied to table "TTAB_ONE" :
      | change | key | value | preset   | something |
      | add    | 14  | AAA   | Preset 1 | AAA       |
