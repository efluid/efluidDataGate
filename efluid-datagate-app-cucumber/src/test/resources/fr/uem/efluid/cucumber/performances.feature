Feature: Performance for diff generation and merge generation are controlled

  @perfCheck
  Scenario: A diff process with large data follow specification references - diff only - small size
    Given the test is a performance standard scenario for variation "perf 051 in db - oracle - diff only"
    And the 1000 generated data in managed table "TTESTMULTIDATATYPE" :
